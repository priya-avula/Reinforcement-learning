🔥🤖 Multi-Agent Fire Fighting Robots
An intelligent system of autonomous robots designed to detect, navigate, and extinguish fires in dynamic environments using collaborative multi-agent coordination and real-time decision-making algorithms.

🧠 Overview
This project simulates and/or controls a fleet of fire-fighting robots capable of:

Detecting fire sources using sensors (e.g., thermal, smoke, infrared)

Navigating environments with obstacles using pathfinding algorithms

Collaborating with other robots using multi-agent systems (MAS)

Deploying fire-extinguishing mechanisms

The system is ideal for applications in smart buildings, warehouses, forests, and emergency response scenarios.

🚀 Features
🔥 Fire detection via simulated or physical sensors

🤝 Cooperative task division among multiple robots

🗺️ Real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance (e.g., A*, Dijkstra)

📡 Communication and coordination protocol (e.g., MQTT, ROS topics)

🧪 Simulation environment (e.g., Gazebo, Webots, Unity, or Python-based)

🔧 Optional hardware integration (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
